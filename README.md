# Data-Modeling-in-Excel
### Introduction:
Welcome to my Data Modeling in Excel! In this project, i explore the world of data organization, analysis and abit of visualization through colour usage using Microsoft Excel. Data modeling in Excel involves structuring data in a way that facilitates analysis, reporting, and decision-making. Kindly refer to further analysis and the Visualization aspect of this project in the "Data analysis project in power BI" repository.

### Project Overview:
- Objective: My objective is to demostrate effective data modeling techniques in Excel to improve data analysis and visualization.
- Tools: I will primarily be using Microsoft Excel for this data modeling, analysis and abit of color usage.
- Dataset: This is close to reality dataset, a business data containing over 9000 rows and 21 columns of Business events/transactions taking place during the business and this dataset is in xlsm.csv format.


### Key Components:
- Data import: import dataset into excel and organize the data for modeling.
- Data Sorting: Sort and prepare the data for accurate modeling and analysis.
- Data Modeling: Create relationships, calculations, and structured tables to model the data effectively.


  ### Contributions:
  - Feedback: i srongly encourage feedback, suggestions, contributions to improve the data modeling techniques demostrated in the project.
  - Issues: Feel free to raise any issues questions related to the data modeling process or Excel functionalities.
 

  My Excel skills keep getting better by the day as i engage in more practice. With Data modeling in excel, I can confidently create a data model with Excel Power Query, create a membership database in Excel, PivotTables, creating a database in Excel with pictures.
  Let's unlock the potential of data modeling in Excel for imformed decision-making and impacttful analysis! :EMOJICODEðŸ’¹ ðŸ’»
